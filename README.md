# Yugioh-Script-Generator-Advanced-Demo
In brief, a mini program that emulates creating .lua files for a gaming platform for a specific game, as if AI was used.



One of the platforms used to play Yugioh (card game) on is EDOPro (commonly known as YGOPro). It makes use of .lua scripts, each one representing one card and utilizing its "effects". 
There are three (technically only two) ways to create/write the scripts:
1. Manually, by individuals.
2. Manually but collaboratively, by groups of people who support the platform.
3. Automatically by using an app.

There are extremely few apps about it that I know of. One of them is my own, ScriptGeneratorYGO, which can be found here: https://github.com/ManolisPy/ScriptGeneratorYGO
I worked on it mostly as my graduate project and has remained very basic since. It makes use of dictionaries and ready parts of code commonly seen in the actual scripts, instead of a more sophisticated way like the use of AI or something.
The idea on the current version is to simply write a card's "effect" (text), for the program to "read" it and create the .lua file automatically. However, no AI tools are used at the moment; just a small combo box, a text box and two ready example codes to work with. The user selects one of the two options in the combo box and the corresponding text appears in the text box. Then, they click a button and voila! file created.

The zipped file contains an executable with the necessary stuff for it to run. The app is easy to use and the instructions are clear. I don't think the modules matter (despite having uploaded them), because my intention is merely to introduce the concept.

Basically: I want to know if it's worth it to spend time on it or if there are alternative methods that are equally as effective (if not better) - not for profit, that should be abvious.
